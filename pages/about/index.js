            Thanks to the internet's constant flow of information and content being shared, almost anything you want to learn can be found online for free. This is no different when it comes to learning a skill like playing an instrument. However, most people struggle with knowing where to begin or how to proceed when confronted with this fact. There are almost too many resources to know what to do with them. With something like learning how to play the drums, there are multiple videos on almost any subject related to drumming, but how are you supposed to know which one of these videos you should watch and what's going to be the most helpful to the progress you are looking to make? If you are using a resource like YouTube, drumming makes up such a small proportion of the content that to find it, you pretty much need to know exactly what you're looking for. The answer to this has traditionally been to take drum lessons from someone around you, maybe at a music store. Some people capitalized on this audience of people looking for guidance and created companies that lay out a very specific path for you to follow at any level. These are companies like Drumeo or DBO Academy, which I would strongly recommend checking out. They have created some excellent content in order to assist as many people as possible, and they even provide live assistance. Drumeo even brings in some of the greatest drummers to date to personally teach lessons. These people, along with many others, also release free content on video platforms like YouTube, but again, you have to know what you're looking for. Ideally, this application bridges that gap for people who want a place to go to learn but cannot afford a membership to one of the mentioned companies. It does this by bringing all of those videos into one place and organizing them to be easy to find and navigate. You can watch the videos right on the site, add any video to your list of favorites, find videos relevant to what you're learning, browse by a list of categories, search for a specific topic, and there's also a test that will help you get started if you are feeling really lost and don't know where to start.
